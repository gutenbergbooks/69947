<p>Representatives of this characteristic South African genus have been
figured on Plates 26 and 72, and we have pleasure in illustrating for
the first time in colour a species which is unique among the species of
<i>Stapelia</i>. It differs from all the known species in having clavate
hairs on the disc. The flowers, though much smaller than many in the
genus, are very beautiful, and lack the unpleasant smell so
characteristic of stapelias.</p>

<p>It is not a common species, and as far as our records go has only been
collected in the Tanqua Karroo by Dr. Marloth, and recently the Division
of Botany received specimens from Mr. E. Anderson, Matjesfontein. This
flowered at Pretoria in February 1923, and our Plate was prepared from
these specimens.</p>

<p>This epiphytic orchid belongs to a tropical African genus of about 6
species, and is the only representative which occurs in South Africa.
The flowers are a pale lemon colour, sometimes barred or blotched with
brown. Specimens were sent to England from Natal prior to 1857, and
might be considered, as was suggested by Hooker and the late Dr. Bolus,
a colour variety of the tropical African <i>Ansellia africana</i>. Mr. Rolfe
in the <i>Flora Capensis</i> considers it to be a distinct species, as
described by Reichenbach, and we have followed his naming. The figure
given by Bolus (<i>Ic. Orch. Austro-Afric.</i> 11. t. 29) represents a colour
form different from that reproduced here.</p>

<p>The plant is found in the mountainous parts of the eastern Transvaal, on
the coast of Natal, and near Delagoa Bay. Our figure was prepared from a
specimen which flowered at the Division of Botany in June 1922, and
which was collected by Mrs. Sinclair Allen on the Lebombo Mountains in
Swaziland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&#8212;<i>Stems</i> elongate, terete or somewhat sulcate, 1/3-1 ft.

</p>

<hr>
<p>It is with pleasure that we figure for the first time this species of
<i>Pachypodium</i>, which flowered at the Division of Botany, Pretoria, in
1923, from tubers forwarded by Mr. J. Kirton, Pietersburg, Transvaal.
The genus <i>Pachypodium</i> differs from <i>Adenium</i> (see Plate 16) in having
a pair of spines at the base of the leaves, but the present species
agrees with <i>Adenium multiflorum</i> in its general habit. Both have large
succulent stems, partly below the ground, from which the branches arise.
In <i>Pachypodium Saundersii</i> the pollination mechanism is somewhat
complicated, but in what way the various structures function in this is
not quite clear. The flowers are protandrous and the anthers all
converge to a point. The base of the anther is provided with a pouch and
the filament with a ciliated hood, and these two structures form a cage
for the pollen. The stigma lies within this cage, and the style may
possibly elongate eventually, and thus push the pollen above the
anthers, as in the <i>Compositae</i>. The plant flowered freely in Pretoria,
but failed to fruit, and from this it may be assumed that
self-pollination does not take place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&#8212;<i>Inflorescence</i> arising in an umbellate manner at apex of
stems, up to 11-flowered. <i>Sepals</i> 4 mm. long, 3·5 mm. broad, ovate,
acuminate, acute, glabrous. <i>Corolla-tube</i> 3·5 cm. long, cylindric and
1·2 cm. long below, with a subglobose base, then suddenly dilated and
narrowed towards the apex, glabrous without, pilose within; lobes 2·2
cm. long, 1·8 cm. broad in the widest part, straight on<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_16">{16}</a></span> one side, very
convex and crisped on opposite side, subacuminate, acute. <i>Filament</i> 3
mm. long, 2 mm. broad, ovate, with a ciliated hood at the base; anthers
6·7 mm. long, linear with a lanceolate, acute appendage 1·5 mm. long,
and a membranous pouch at the base. <i>Style</i> 1·3 cm. long, terete,
glabrous; stigma club-shaped covered with a white opaque jelly-like
substance; ovary 3·5 mm. long, with a cupular disk at the base (National

<p>This <i>Aloe</i> is another of the many species from the Transvaal described
within recent years by Dr. Pole Evans, and it is here figured for the
first time. Our Plate was prepared from plants collected by Mr. D. J.
Fouche in the Middleburg District, Transvaal, and which subsequently
flowered at the Division of Botany, Pretoria. The specimens on which Dr.
Pole Evans based his description were found by Mr. P. J. Pienaar on the
Wolkberg, near Haenertsberg, in the Northern Transvaal. In the natural
state it usually flowers towards the latter part of December, and the
dark red racemes are then very conspicuous. As soon as winter sets in,
the leaves wither and fall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&#8212;<i>Stem</i> short. <i>Leaves</i> 8-10, distichous, deciduous, 25-35
cm. long, 8-10 mm. broad at the base, narrowly linear, distinctly
channelled, rounded at the back, with numerous minute raised white spots
at the base, armed along the edges with delicate white teeth 2-7 mm.
apart. <i>Peduncle</i> stout, 25 cm. long, clothed with broad ovate shortly
cuspidate green empty bracts. <i>Raceme</i> more or less capitate. <i>Bracts</i>
20 mm. long, 15 mm. broad, ovate, acute. <i>Pedicels</i> 25 mm. long.
<i>Perianth</i> peach-red to scarlet, greenish towards the apex, 26-30 mm.
long, 12 mm. in diameter, straight, very markedly 3-angled, contracted
towards the mouth; segments free. <i>Style</i> and <i>stamens</i> not or scarcely

<p>This <i>Gladiolus</i> belongs to the same section of the genus as <i>G.
Rehmanni</i>, figured on Plate 20. The variety <i>calvatus</i> has up to the
present only been recorded from the Pretoria and Barberton Districts of
the Transvaal, but the species is a native of Natal, East Griqualand and
the Transkei. The specimens from which our illustration was made were
collected by Dr. I. B. Pole Evans, C.M.G., at Brits, and were found
growing in deep black turf soil. The variety is also figured in the
<i>Botanical Magazine</i>, t. 6291, and a comparison of that plate with the
one reproduced here will show a difference in the colouring of the
flowers, but Dr. Pole Evans states that the pale yellow and speckled
forms grow together and are undoubtedly the same. The yellow-flowered
form was introduced into cultivation in England in 1877, and both this
and our plant differ from the species in being glabrous.</p>

<p><i>Strumaria</i> is a small endemic South African genus, and five species
have been described in the <i>Flora Capensis</i>, all of which have been
figured by Jacquin in his <i>Icones Plantarum Rariorum</i>. Two of the
species are recorded from Little Namaqualand, but no locality is known
for the other three, nor do any specimens appear to exist in herbaria,
Jacquin’s figures and descriptions being all we know about them. It is
with particular pleasure, therefore, that we reproduce this illustration
of a species of this little-known genus, and our readers are again
indebted to Mrs. E. Rood of Van Rhynsdorp for sending us fresh material.
Our plant differs slightly from Jacquin’s figure, inasmuch as the
dilated portion of the style does not narrow towards the base and is
irregularly lobed above, but on this account we do not feel justified in
keeping it distinct from <i>Strumaria truncata</i>.</p>

<p><i>Strumaria truncata</i> is a charming little plant with an umbel of white,
sweet-smelling flowers, faintly tinged with pink (the <i>Flora Capensis</i>
states flowers “inodorous”). The bulbs received from Mrs. Rood are being
grown at the Division of Botany, Pretoria, and we feel sure once the
species becomes known it will be sought after by cultivators of our
South African bulbs.</p>

<p>We have previously figured species of <i>Mimetes</i>, viz. <i>M. palustris</i>
(Pl. 36), <i>M. hottentotica</i> (Pl. 82) and <i>M. capitulata</i> (Pl. 58), and a
comparison of the present Plate with the above will show that <i>M.
argentea</i> differs from the former two species in the cylindric, not
swollen, stigma, and from the latter in the larger leaves and the
greater number of flowers in each head.</p>

<p><i>M. argentea</i>, up to the time of the publication of the <i>Flora
Capensis</i>, was only known from specimens collected by Roxburgh, Masson
and Niven over one hundred years ago, and it was only recently that the
species was rediscovered. In May 1923, Mr. A. T. Prentice collected
specimens near Villiersdorp, very probably in the same locality visited
by Masson. Mr. Prentice writes: “They were found on the slopes of the
south (<i>i.e.</i> Villiersdorp) side of French Hoek Peak about 3000 ft.
There were about 50 trees, 3-6 ft. high, and the habit is different from
most of the <i>Proteaceae</i> I have noticed. I do not know how to describe
it, but it is very open and something like a candelabra, branching all
round. The flower spikes all stick straight up, in fact it grows like
the advertised type of pruned apple-tree.” Mr. R. Hallack came across
the species on the Hottentot Holland Mountains, and in June last Mr. T.
P. Stokoe also collected it on the same mountain range. He had noted the
plant two years previously, but was unable to obtain it in flower. It is
from specimens forwarded by Mr. Stokoe that the present Plate was
prepared.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_36">{36}</a></span></p>

<hr>

<p>On Plate 56 we figured a species of <i>Polyxena (P. haemanthoides)</i>, and
gave a few remarks on the genus. The present species, collected by Mr.
A. J. Austin at Matjesfontein, C. P., was at first thought to be <i>P.
pygmaea</i>, Kunth, but it differs in many respects from the published
figures, and as it agrees quite well with Schönland’s description of <i>P.
ensifolia</i>, we have decided to place it under this species for the
present. Dr. Schönland, who saw the living plant at Pretoria, suggested
that it was a species differing both from <i>P. ensifolia</i> and <i>P.
pygmaea</i>; but until we know more about the genus both as regards the
variability of the species and its distribution, it seems desirable to
regard it as a form of P. ensifolia.</p>

<p><i>P. ensifolia</i> is a pretty little plant. The leaves are semi-erect and
the inflorescence of pale lilac flowers arises between them. It does
quite well under cultivation, and has flowered for two seasons at the
Division of Botany, Pretoria. We are indebted to Mr. Austin for the
original bulbs.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Habenaria</i> figured here has a wide range of distribution
in South Africa. Starting from Swellendam in the south, it follows more
or less the littoral strip as far as Port Alfred, and then spreads
inland through the Transkei and East Griqualand into Natal, and through
Basutoland and the eastern part of the Free State and up into the
Transvaal Drakensbergen. The species is also met with in the Pretoria
District, which is outside its normal range of distribution. In
Basutoland the natives call it “<i>Mametsana</i>,” meaning “the mother of the
small water.” The spur contains a watery substance which becomes
jelly-like on exposure to air.</p>

<p>Around Pretoria the plant flowers in late summer, about February, after
the rains, and is then frequently met with in the veld. The plate was
prepared from specimens collected by Dr. I. B. Pole Evans, C.M.G., at

described it in the <i>Kew Bulletin</i> (1895, p. 151) under the name of

of the Transvaal, but has not been extensively collected. Mr. Galpin
describes it as “abundant amongst scrub on the hillsides and in the
valleys around Barberton, flowering throughout the year, but chiefly in
June and July.” In cultivation it grows to a rather dense bush 2 to 4
feet high, and flowers profusely. Very fine specimens are in cultivation
at the National Botanic Gardens, Kirstenbosch, and we are indebted to
the Director of the gardens for the fresh material from which the

<p>It is the first occasion that we figure a species of one of the most
beautiful of South African genera, namely <i>Nerine</i>. <i>N. sarniensis</i>,
known as the “Guernsey Lily,” and to mountaineers in the Cape as the
“Nerina,” ranks with <i>Disa uniflora</i> as one of the floral beauties of
Table Mountain. The species illustrated, while it does not equal its
Cape congener in the size of its flowers, is a charming little plant
when seen growing. It differs from the closely allied genus <i>Hessea</i>
(see Plate 43) in having dorsifixed instead of basifixed anthers, and
belongs to a small group of species in the genus <i>Nerine</i> which have the
anthers appendiculate at the base. The species has been successfully
grown in the National Botanic Gardens at Kirstenbosch, near Cape Town,
and was described by Mrs. L. Bolus from specimens which flowered at
Kirstenbosch. Our plate was prepared from specimens which flowered at
the Division of Botany, Pretoria. The plant figured differs from the
description in not having two of the lobes of the staminal cup longer
than the others, but Mrs. Bolus, who kindly examined our specimens,
agrees that it is <i>N. Frithii</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&#8212;<i>Bulb</i> 2 cm. long, 1·7 cm. in diameter, ovoid-globose.

an umbel of 5 to 7 flowers. <i>Peduncle</i> up to 20 cm. long, terete.
<i>Spathe-valves</i> 2·5 to 3 cm. long, oblong, long-attenuate. <i>Pedicels</i> up

<p>This species is, so far as we know, confined to the dry western portions
of the Cape Province, S.W. Protectorate, Transvaal, and Orange Free
State. Burchell found the plant both in Griqualand West and in
Bechuanaland, and Burke on his journey up to the Transvaal found it near
the Sand River in the Orange Free State. In habit the species very much
resembles a dwarf <i>Brunsvigia</i>, but is distinguished from this genus by
the obtusely angled ovary. The short stout peduncle is also found in two
other species of <i>Nerine</i>.</p>

<p>A coloured plant of <i>N. lucida</i> was published in 1820 (<i>Botanical
Register</i>, Plate 497), drawn from a plant which flowered in the garden
of Prince Leopold of Saxe-Cobourg.</p>

<p>The specimens from which the accompanying Plate was prepared were
collected at Vryburg by Mr. A. O. D. Mogg, and flowered at the Division

<p>On Plate 32 of this work we figured a species of <i>Haemanthus</i> (<i>H.

involucral-bracts erect instead of spreading. <i>Haemanthus Katharinae</i>,
with its spreading involucral-bracts and perianth-segments, is unique in

inflorescence figured was an odd flower with 8 perianth-lobes and 8
stamens.</p>

<p>When Mr. Brown first described this remarkable genus in 1880, he only
knew of Masson’s and Thunberg’s specimens, and up to the time of the
account in the <i>Flora Capensis</i> (1909) Dr. Marloth was the only recent
collector who had found the plant. Mrs. D. van der Bijl, of Abraham’s
Kraal, in the Beaufort West District, who has contributed several
interesting plants we have figured, sent us specimens in 1919, which
flowered at the Division of Botany, Pretoria, this year.</p>

<p>It was figured in a coloured plate by Masson in 1796, and our present
Plate is the first to be produced since then. A pencil drawing of a
portion of the flower, the corona and the pollinia, accompanied Brown’s
original description, and while our specimen differs in some minor
points from the drawings, we have no hesitation in referring it to the
same species. The flower is rather handsome, and devoid of the
objectionable smell usually associated with the members of the tribe
<i>Stapelieae</i>.</p>

pedicels 1 to 2 cm. long, erect, glabrous. <i>Sepals</i> about 6 mm. long,
ovate or ovate-lanceolate, acute, glabrous. <i>Corolla</i> about 7·5 cm. in

<p>This species of <i>Urginea</i> is well known to the farmers of the Transvaal
under the common name of “Transvaal Slangkop,” owing to the somewhat
striking resemblance of the young inflorescence to a snake’s head. The
plant is extremely poisonous to stock, and in early spring many
fatalities are reported. For a fuller account of this plant see Bulletin
No. 7, 1922, of the Union Department of Agriculture. Burke first
collected the species on the Magaliesberg about 1830, but it remained
undescribed until Baker published his description in the <i>Flora
Capensis</i> in 1896.</p>

<p>The specimen figured on the accompanying Plate was grown and flowered in
the garden of the Division of Botany, Pretoria.</p>

<p>Our Plate represents a variety of <i>Nerine flexuosa</i> found in the
Transvaal, which is distinguished from the type in having a more robust
inflorescence. It very much resembles <i>N. lucida</i>, figured on Plate 134,
but the peduncle is much longer and not so stout. Very little is known
about this variety. It is recorded in the <i>Flora Capensis</i> as collected
by Sanderson in the Transvaal, and does not appear to have been found
again by any recent collector. When planted in a mass it makes a very
effective display as soon as the flowers appear.</p>

<hr>

<p>The species of <i>Ceropegia</i>, figured here for the first time, belongs to
the same group in the genus as <i>C. Meyeri</i> (Plate 30), which is
characterised by the tips of the petals being connate and forming a
cage-like top to the flower. <i>Ceropegia ampliata</i> is one of the five
South African species collected by Drège, all of which were described by
E. Meyer.</p>

<p>The plant is a twiner or scrambler, devoid of leaves at the flowering
period. The flowers are pale green with a purple band within the
corolla-tube, which is visible through the wall of the tube. It is not
such a striking plant as some of the species we have previously figured,
but the purple band on a background of green gives the individual flower
a very pleasing effect.</p>

<p>Our Plate was prepared from a living plant lent by Mr. W. Haygarth to
the late Dr. J. Medley Wood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&#8212;<i>Stem</i> succulent, twining or scrambling, leafless at the

resemblance of the young inflorescence to a snake’s head, has been
recorded from the Umvoti District along the coast of Natal, and also
from the Transkei. The inflorescence makes its appearance in early
spring, and is then eaten by stock, when other herbage is scarce, with
fatal results (for an account of symptoms due to “slangkop” poisoning
see Bulletin No. 7 of 1922, Dept. Agric. Union S. Africa). During the
spring months, especially if the rains are later than usual, losses of
stock in parts where this “slangkop” occurs are of almost annual
occurrence.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Wood stated that he did not think <i>U. macrocentra</i> was
specifically distinct from <i>U. lilacina</i>. He carefully compared his
specimens of the latter-named plant with the former, and could detect no
difference, and suggested that the specimens described by Baker as <i>U.
lilacina</i> were merely <i>U. macrocentra</i> which had lost the conspicuous
spurs, these being very early deciduous.</p>

one of a group of four species characterised by the corolla-lobes being
united into an umbrella-like canopy supported by 5 short stalks. The
species on the accompanying plate is another of this group, and should
be compared with <i>C. Rendalii</i> and <i>C. tristis</i> (Plate 44).</p>

<p>The original description and plate appeared in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i>
in 1869, and were based on specimens sent to Kew by Mr. Sanderson in
1868, and which subsequently flowered there. The plant lends itself very
well to cultivation in the green-house, and is an object of beauty and
curiosity when in flower. It does not appear to have been extensively
collected, and may not be very common. In its native habitat it flowers
during the month of February.</p>

<p>As far as we are aware, there is no local name for the plant, and we
would therefore suggest “Sanderson’s Canopy Flower” as an appropriate
name. According to Gerrard the stems and leaves are eaten by the Kaffirs
and have an agreeable, sauce-like flavour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1889 a good coloured plate of this plant was reproduced in the
<i>Botanical Magazine</i>. The plate was prepared from plants sent to Kew by
the late Dr. Medley Wood, and which flowered freely there in the open.
<i>Anoiganthus breviflorus</i> is readily distinguished from species of
<i>Cyrtanthus</i> (species of which we figured in earlier plates) by having
basifixed, not versatile anthers. It is a fairly widely distributed
species, being found as far south as Somerset East, and spreading
northward through the eastern parts of the Cape Province into Natal,
Zululand, Basutoland, Swaziland and to Broken Hill, N.W. Rhodesia. The
same yellow colour of the flowers is found in species of <i>Cyrtanthus</i>,
but specimens with white flowers have been recorded.</p>

<p>The species does quite well in cultivation, and in its native habitat
thrives in swampy and marshy ground.</p>

<p>Our plate was prepared from plants collected near Springfield (Durban),
Natal.</p>

<p>[There appears to be a second and quite distinct species (<i>A. luteus</i>
Baker) of this interesting little genus, though Baker in the <i>Flora
Capensis</i> treated it as a variety. That it is distinct enough to be
regarded as a species was very strongly supported by the late Dr. J.
Medley Wood. According to him <i>A. breviflorus</i> grows in swampy ground,
commencing at about 1500 ft. above sea level, and is found upwards to
4000 ft. He observed it occasionally to 4 ft. in height, but the average
was 2 to 3 ft. On the other hand, <i>A. luteus</i> appears on grassy hills
and plains from just above<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_100">{100}</a></span> sea level to 2000 ft., but never in swamps.
During the flowering stage it is rarely more than about 1 ft. high, but
afterwards, in fruit, the scape lengthens considerably and often attains
2 ft. in length. These observations by Dr. Wood are confirmed by a
critical examination of the specimens at Kew. The flowers and leaves
appear to be always contemporaneous in <i>A. breviflorus</i>, but in <i>A.

<p><i>Burchellia bubalina</i> is known locally as “Buffels-hoorn” (not
“Buffelsdoorn”), on account of the horn-like calyx lobes, which persist
on the fruit. The bright-red flowers give rise to the name “Wild
pomegranate,” or “Wilde granaat.” There are also various native names
for the plant.</p>

<p>The single species of this genus is endemic to South Africa, and has a
wide distribution. In the south-west it is known as far as Swellendam,
whence it ranges through the forests to Natal and the Transvaal. Mr.
Galpin has recorded the plant from the summit of Saddleback Mountain, at
4500 to 5000 ft., where it occurs as a shrub 8 ft. high. It is somewhat
variable, the corolla differing much in size, and the length and
hairiness of the style fluctuates, perhaps due to sexual differences.
The calyx lobes are either 5 or 6 on the same plant.</p>

<p>No less than six different names have been applied to this species. Of
these we have, with some reluctance, adopted the oldest, <i>B. bubalina</i>,
Sims, using the specific name first applied by the younger Linnaeus in
1781 under the genus <i>Lonicera</i> for specimens collected by Sparmann. A
better known name is <i>B. capensis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thunbergia natalensis</i> was described and figured in 1858 from plants
cultivated by Messrs. Veitch of Chelsea, from seed received from South
Africa. A year later Harvey gave a picture of the species in his
<i>Thesaurus Capensis</i> (Plate 38). The <i>Flora Capensis</i> does not mention
the peculiar stalked glandular hairs found on the funnel-shaped part of
the style, though Hooker accurately figured these, neither does Harvey
show them in his figure nor mention them in his description, although he
was acquainted with the drawing in the <i>Botanical Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>The plant is a small shrub bearing large blue flowers with a bright
yellow throat, and is confined to the eastern parts of the Cape
Province, Natal, and the spurs of the Drakensbergen in the Transvaal.
Notwithstanding its showy nature, it escaped the notice of the old
collectors in Natal and the Transkei.</p>

<p>The species is worth the attention of horticulturists, and should find
greater favour among growers who cultivate our native plants.</p>

<hr>

<p><i>Thunbergia alata</i> is a native of tropical Africa and Natal, but has
been introduced into many warm parts of the world as an ornamental
creeper, and it is often called “Black-eyed Susan.” It was first
described and figured in 1825 from plants raised in England from seed
collected in Mauritius.</p>

<p>In its natural habitat the species is found as a creeper in woods, and
the bright-orange corolla with a dark maroon throat gives the flower a
singularly beautiful effect. The plant grows readily under cultivation,
and makes a fine trellis creeper, but in colder countries it requires
the protection of a glass-house.</p>

<p>The petioles of the mature leaves, as will be seen from the plate, are
distinctly winged, but in the younger leaves they are almost terete. The
stamens, as is usually the case in the family <i>Acanthaceae</i>, are
appendaged in some way, and exhibit two forms in this species. All the
anthers are tailed, but the anther of the shorter stamen, instead of
having two tails, is only tailed at the base of one pollen-sac, the
other pollen-sac bearing a bunch of radiating glandular hairs.</p>

<p><i>Aloe Peglerae</i> is quite a common plant in parts of the Transvaal, and
may be found in quantities on the stony hills of the Magaliesberg round
Pretoria. The species was first described by Dr. S. Schönland in 1903
from specimens collected by Miss Alice Pegler near Rustenburg. The
peculiar lax arrangement of the leaves is very characteristic, and Miss
Pegler not inaptly compared its appearance to a loose cabbage.</p>

<p>In the description accompanying Plate 107 (<i>Aloe comosa</i>) we described
the method in which the flowers mature. <i>Aloe Peglerae</i>, as far as we
have observed, is an exception to this general rule, as the style is
exserted with the filaments and does not wait until the filaments are
withdrawn, and the perianth withers before protruding.</p>

<hr>

<p>This somewhat rare <i>Aloe</i> was first described by Dr. Schönland from
material collected by Max Schlechter at Pella, S.W. Africa. The Division
of Botany in 1921 received living specimens from Dr. W. Borchards of
Upington, and these subsequently flowered at Pretoria.</p>

<p><i>Aloe Schlechteri</i> is found growing on the bare veld. The short stems
are decumbent and the rosette of leaves almost at right angles to the
stems, giving the plant, when viewed from a little distance, an
acaulescent appearance. The plants are invariably found in groups, and
the individual plants are so arranged that the group forms a half-circle
or sometimes a complete circle on the ground. The inflorescence appears
to be always forked.</p>

<p>Our illustration was made from the specimens collected by Dr. Borchards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&#8212;<i>Stem</i> short decumbent with a dense rosette of leaves.

beneath, flat or slightly convex above, with the margins covered with
prickles and a few prickles on the keel beneath near the apex; prickles
about 1·2 cm. apart, straight or slightly incurved. <i>Inflorescence</i>
branched into two arms; the common peduncle about 10 cm. long, bluntly
3-angled, naked; peduncle of arms up to lowermost flowers 9 cm. long,

which flowered at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in August 1889. As the
plant has been described under the generic name of <i>Montbretia</i> in the
<i>Flora Capensis</i> we retain the combination here.</p>

<hr>

<p>This beautiful little <i>Oxalis</i> belongs to a small group of about eight
species which are characterised by having the leaves digitately 5-to
19-foliate, and in some respects these species are more showy than many
of the others.</p>

<p>The genus as a whole is essentially characteristic of the south-western
portion of the Cape Province, but scattered species are found in various
parts of the Union. Species of <i>Oxalis</i> are also abundant in South
America, where some of them form tall shrubs.</p>

<p>Heterostylism, <i>i. e.</i> the different relative lengths of the stamens and
styles, is found in the genus. In some flowers the styles exceed the
stamens, while in others the stamens are longer than the styles. This
arrangement of the sexual organs ensures that cross-pollination will
take place.</p>

<p>Our plate was prepared from specimens grown at the Division of Botany,
Pretoria, from corms presented by Dr. C. L. Leipoldt, who collected them
at Pakhuis in the Clanwilliam Division. According to Dr. Leipoldt the
corms are edible.</p>

<p>This <i>Aloe</i> was first collected and photographed by Dr. Pole Evans at
Nelspruit in September 1905. In the Nelspruit Valley (Barberton
District) the plant is found chiefly on the granite outcrops, and in
similar localities at Eland’s Hoek and in the Kaap Valley, where it was
collected by Mr. Geo. Thorncroft. Like most of our Transvaal aloes, it
flowers in mid-winter (July), and the flowering period extends well into
August. <i>Aloe petricola</i> is one of the stemless species, and the
bicoloured inflorescence makes it quite a striking plant in the rockery.
In the oldest flowers the filaments contract within the perianth, and
the style then becomes exserted.</p>

<hr>

<p>The genus <i>Euphorbia</i> is represented in South Africa by one hundred and
eighty-three species, and we figure a representative of this genus for
the first time. The genus contains many species which are of economic
value as stock-food plants in the drier parts of the country, and among
these may be mentioned <i>E. esculenta</i>, Marl. (Vingerpol), <i>E.
brachiata</i>, E. Mey. (Soet or Blou Melkbos), <i>E. coerulescens</i>, Haw.
(Soet Noorsdoring), and several other species which are commonly known
as “Noorsdoring.”</p>

<p>The species figured here is one of the arborescent members of the
family, and is found in Natal and in the Rustenburg and Piet Potgieter’s
Rust Districts of the Transvaal. It is easily recognised by the
continuous horny margins on the stems.</p>

<p>The plant when cut exudes a copious milky juice, which is a skin
irritant, and which also causes a burning sensation in the throat if the
air is inhaled when standing in close proximity to a bleeding plant.</p>

<p>This species of <i>Lachenalia</i> was amongst some of the earliest of the
Cape introductions into the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, having been
sent by Masson in 1774. About the same time, or probably earlier, it was
introduced into the gardens of Holland, and was eventually imported into
England from Holland. In 1801 an excellent figure appeared in the
<i>Botanical Magazine</i> (Plate 590).</p>

<p><i>Lachenalia pendula</i> is a robust species of the genus, and is easily
cultivated. It flowers freely under cultivation, and makes a very
effective display.</p>

<p>Our plate was prepared from specimens grown by Dr. I. B. Pole Evans,
C.M.G., from bulbs supplied by Lady Smartt.</p>

<hr>

<p>We have pleasure in figuring for the first time this charming little
<i>Cyrtanthus</i> from the Barberton District of the Transvaal. According to
Mr. G. J. Hofmeyr, B.Sc., of the Forest Department, who collected the
flowers, the plants are found growing in long grass at Kaapse Hoop. The
plant is subsocial, and forms conspicuous pink patches in the veld. Mr.
Hofmeyr informs us that the flowers at Barberton are scarlet, and not
alizams pink (R. C. S), as in the Kaapse Hoop plants.</p>

<p>The species was first collected by Mr. E. E. Galpin, F.L.S., amongst
rocks on Berea Ridge, near Barberton, in 1889. He describes the flowers
as scarlet, dusted with gold. It flowers during the months of July and
August.</p>

<p><i>C. Galpini</i> falls into the same section of the genus as <i>C. helictus</i>,
which we figured on Plate 99.</p>

<p>Our plate was partly prepared from Galpin’s specimens (<i>Galpin</i> 409) and
partly from living flowers collected by Mr. Hofmeyr.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&#8212;<i>Bulb</i> ovoid, 2·5 to 3 mm. in diameter. <i>Leaves</i> appearing
before the flowers, up to 8 cm. long, 2 mm. broad above, narrowing to a
filiform portion below, with a single rib, glabrous. <i>Peduncle</i> 10 to 19
cm. long, 3 mm. in diameter, terete, very gradually narrowing upwards.
<i>Bracts</i> 2·5 to 3 cm. long, scarious, linear, acuminate. <i>Flowers</i>
solitary, more rarely 2-nate. <i>Perianth-tube</i> with a narrow-cylindric
lower portion 1·5 cm. long, broadening out into a funnel-shaped portion
2 cm. long and 1·3 cm. in diameter<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_160">{160}</a></span> at the throat; lobes 2 cm. long, 7
to 9 mm. broad, oblong, bluntly apiculate, with a very small tuft of
glandular hairs on the apex of three of them. <i>Stamens</i> all arising from
the base of the widened portion of the perianth-tube; filaments of
unequal lengths and attached to the perianth-tube for different
distances, giving the stamens the appearance of being in two rows;
anthers oblong, versatile. <i>Ovary</i> 5 mm. long, ellipsoid; style 3-8 cm.
long, filiform; stigmas 3 mm. long, recurved, papillose on the upper
side.</p>

<p>This graceful little <i>Aloe</i>, so far as we are aware, is confined to the
Barberton District of the Transvaal. The plant has a very different
habit from most species in the genus, inasmuch as it grows in large
tufts, and the short stem, covered with the membranous leaf-bases, very
much resembles that of a <i>Vellozia</i>.</p>

<p>We are indebted to Mr. Geo. Thorncroft of Barberton for the specimens
from which the plate was prepared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Description</span>:&#8212;<i>Stems</i> tufted, covered with the remains of the
leaf-bases; leaves 10 to 20 cm. long, linear from a dilated base,
channelled, with the margins lined with small spines. <i>Peduncle</i> 16 cm.
long, bearing, almost to the base, membranous ovate awned bracts.
<i>Floral-bracts</i> 1·4 cm. long, membranous, ovate, long-acuminate,
distinctly veined. <i>Pedicels</i> articulating at the apex and persistent.
<i>Perianth</i> 3 cm. long, with a cylindric tube and 1-nerved lobes.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
